# Ascribe.vim

The Vim implementation of [Ascribe](https://axvr.io/projects/ascribe): a simpler
alternative to [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

Ascribe is a standard for software development tools (specifically editors) to
retrieve and handle useful information about various files within a project
through the `.gitattributes` file already found in many software projects.

By using the `.gitattributes` file, Ascribe keeps all information about the
files in a project in a single place, and encourages the improvement of
existing—and arguably more useful—`.gitattributes` parsers.

Ascribe extensions (such as this one) tend to be much smaller, faster and
simpler than their EditorConfig counterparts.
